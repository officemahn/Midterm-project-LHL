## Project/Goals


## Process
Cleaning the Data
The initial step involved cleaning the data and creating appropriate tables to normalize the dataset.

Normalizing the Data
1. Table Creation:
   Six tables were created to normalize the data:
   airport_info, arrival_delay, carrier_info, flight_delay_time, flight_info, flight_details

2. Standardizing the Format: Ensured a standardized format across tables for consistency.

3. Primary Key and Foreign Key Assignment:
   Assigned primary keys to uniquely identify records in each table.
   Established foreign key relationships to connect related tables.
   
Data Cleaning
1. Data Insertion:
   Relevant data was moved and inserted into the appropriate tables.
   
2. Handling Irrelevant Data and Null Values:
   Filtered out irrelevant data and addressed null values appropriately.
   
3. Table Alterations and Updates:
   Altered table structures and updated empty or missing values.
   
Data Type Validation
1. Case Statements:
   Employed case statements to populate columns based on predefined criteria.
   
2. Removing Irrelevant Data and Empty Columns:
   Removed irrelevant data and columns with no useful information.

3. Data Testing:
   Conducted tests to validate data consistency and accuracy.
   
4. Checking for Null Values:
   Implemented checks for null values to maintain data integrity.
