## Process
### Cleaning the Data
The initial step involved cleaning the data and creating appropriate tables to normalize the dataset.

#### Normalizing the Data
1. Table Creation:
   Six tables were created to normalize the data:
   airport_info, arrival_delay, carrier_info, flight_delay_time, flight_info, flight_details

2. Ensured a standardized format across tables for consistency.

3. Assigned primary keys to uniquely identify records in each table and  foreign key relationships to connect related tables.
   
#### Data Cleaning
1. Relevant data was moved and inserted into the appropriate tables.
   
2. Filtered out irrelevant data and addressed null values appropriately.
   
3. Altered table structures and updated empty or missing values.
   
#### Data Type Validation
1. Employed case statements to populate columns based on predefined criteria.
   
2. Conducted tests to validate data consistency and accuracy.
   
3. Implemented checks for null values to maintain data integrity.
