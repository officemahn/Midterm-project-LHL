##### Project by: Angelo Reyes & David Oladipo 

##### Dataset: [United States Airline Delays for December 2019 and 2020.](https://www.openintro.org/data/csv/airline_delay.csv)

## Project/Goals
The airline industry is a significant driver of the global economy, with an estimated market size just below 814.5 billion U.S. dollars in the United States last year. However, it faces various challenges that impact carriers, airports, and passengers alike. Flight delays, redirections, and cancellations have substantial financial repercussions and pose considerable inconveniences to travelers. The increasing demand for air travel, coupled with shortages in staff, suggests that delays may become more prevalent. The purpose of our project is to analyze trends in flight delays from 2019 to 2020, focusing on data from the United States. By examining the causes of delays, including carrier-related issues, security concerns, weather conditions, and contributions from the National Aviation System (NAS), we aim to provide insights into the challenges faced by the U.S. airline industry and propose potential solutions to mitigate the impact of delays on both operational efficiency and passenger experience.


## Process
### Cleaning the Data
The initial step involved cleaning the data and creating appropriate tables to normalize the dataset.

#### Normalizing the Data
1. Table Creation:
   Six tables were created to normalize the data:
   airport_info, arrival_delay, carrier_info, flight_delay_time, flight_info, flight_details

2. Ensured a standardized format across tables for consistency.

3. Assigned primary keys to uniquely identify records in each table and  foreign key relationships to connect related tables.
   
#### Data Cleaning
1. Relevant data was moved and inserted into the appropriate tables.
   
2. Filtered out irrelevant data and addressed null values appropriately.
   
3. Altered table structures and updated empty or missing values.
   
#### Data Type Validation
1. Employed case statements to populate columns based on predefined criteria.
   
2. Conducted tests to validate data consistency and accuracy.
   
3. Implemented checks for null values to maintain data integrity.
